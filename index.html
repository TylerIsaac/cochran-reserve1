        <div class='step-container'>
          <div class='question'>Why reserve a vehicle?</div>
          <div class='row-three'>You may be tired of calling every dealerhip in the area trying to see what is actually
             available, or you may just have specific wants or needs in a vehicle that you know will be 
            difficult to find with today’s inventory shortages. Reserving a vehicle with us guarantees 
            that you will receive the exact specifications you decide on, and that no one will beat you 
            to the punch once the car comes in. Plus, it puts you first in line with no obligation if you 
            change your mind.</div>
        </div>

        <div class='step-container'>
          <div class='question'>How do I know I’m getting a fair deal?</div>
          <div class='row-three'>We still apply our <b>ClearCut Pricing Policy</b> to preordered vehicles 
            and never charge over MSRP.</div>
        </div>

        <div class='step-container'>
          <div class='question'>How long does delivery take?</div>
          <div class='row-three'>Delivery time varies based on the manufacturer. We suggest talking to your product 
            specialist to determine a time frame for delivery of your exact vehicle.</div>
        </div>

        <div class='step-container'>
          <div class='question'>What if I change my mind?</div>
          <div class='row-three'>In most cases, we do not require a deposit to reserve your vehicle. Although we 
            guarantee the vehicle will be available to you first, if you do change your mind, you will 
            not be obligated to buy.</div>
        </div>

        <div class='disc''>We reserve the right to change this policy at anytime, based on specifications of the vehicle ordered.</div>

        <div class='step-container'>
          <div class='question'>What if I don’t like the vehicle?</div>
          <div class='row-three'>You can still take advantage of our 3-day/150-mile money back guarantee, so you have 
            ultimate peace of mind. See your sales consultant for written details on this program.</div>
